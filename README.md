## Installation

Ensure Conda is installed on your system. If not, download it from the [official Conda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). Follow these steps to set up `QuantGPT`:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the `QuantGPT` repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rnikitin/quantgpt.git
cd quantgpt
```

### Step 2: Create and Activate Conda Environment

Create a Conda environment with Python 3.10 and activate it:

```bash
conda create --name quantgpt python=3.10
conda activate quantgpt
```

### Step 3: Install Scrapy

Within the Conda environment, install Scrapy using either Conda or pip:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge scrapy
```

or

```bash
pip install Scrapy
```

Refer to the [official Scrapy documentation](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/install.html) for more details.

### Step 4: Install Remaining Dependencies

With Scrapy installed, use `pip` to install the other necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 5: Set Up Environment Variables

Rename `env.example` to `.env` and fill in the necessary variables:

**Mandatory Variables:**
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-XXXX"
GPT_MODEL="gpt-4"
```

**Optional Variables:**
Acquire these from Chainlit Cloud if needed [here](https://cloud.getliteral.ai/)
Or remove them completely, if you don't need persistence at the moment.
You can read more about persistence and Literal AI platform [here](https://docs.chainlit.io/data-persistence/overview#enable-data-persistence-in-1-minute).

```bash
LITERAL_API_KEY="cl_XXX"
```

How to generate `CHAINLIT_AUTH_SECRET` you can read [here](https://docs.chainlit.io/authentication/overview).
To add `CHAINLIT_AUTH_SECRET` to `.env` file you can use the following command:

```bash
chainlit create-secret
```



### Step 6: Run the Scraper

Navigate to the `quant_scraper` directory to prepare for running the scraper:

```bash
cd quant_scraper
```

Execute the scraper, passing in the `secret_url` directly into the command:

```bash
scrapy crawl vbt_pro -a secret_url="pvt_XXXX"
```

`pvt_XXXX` should be obtained from [VectorBT Pro Membership](https://vectorbt.pro/become-a-member/).

After completion, navigate back to the project's root directory:

```bash
cd ..
```

### Step 7: Launch the UI

With everything set up, initiate the user interface:

```bash
chainlit run quantgpt.py
```

Allow 3-5 minutes on the first run to build the Vector Store index, depending on your internet connection speed.

### Start Using QuantGPT

Your setup of `QuantGPT` is complete. The default AI model is GPT-4, but you can adjust this in the `.env` file. Be aware of the costs for indexing and requests, which may be around $1 for indexing and $0.2 per request.

## How It Works

`QuantGPT` operates on a sequence of steps involving data extraction, transformation, and response generation:

1. **Data Extraction:**
   - **Web Crawling:** Utilizing `Scrapy`, the system programmatically navigates the vectorbt pro documentation website to retrieve content.

2. **Transformation:**
   - **Indexing:** The `llama_index` module processes the collected data, segmenting documents based on markdown headers ("## ") into indexed sections.
   - **Question Generation:** To augment the indexed content, `gpt-3.5-turbo` generates related questions for each section, expanding the metadata for the documents.
   - **VectorIndex Integration:** The resulting document sections, along with their metadata, are stored in the `VectorIndex`.

3. **Response Generation:**
   - **Document Retrieval:** In response to user queries, the system extracts relevant sections from the `VectorIndex`.
   - **Summary Composition:** It employs the tree_summary method to synthesize the information into a coherent and contextually relevant answer.

The approach aims to deliver SOTA quality answers from extensive documentation, with the trade-off being higher payment costs per query.

## Usage

`QuantGPT` is designed to interface with Chainlit, leveraging its robust chatbot UI capabilities, ideal for interacting with and evaluating large language models (LLMs) for quantitative trading applications.

### Initial Access

Upon launching the app, you may be prompted for login credentials. Use the following default combination:

**Username:** admin
**Password:** admin

This authentication step is required by Chainlit for those who require persistence within their instance. It is a placeholder and should be replaced with proper authentication measures in production or if sensitive data is being handled.

### Conversational Interface

The application presents itself as a chat interface, providing an intuitive way to interact with the underlying AI. However, it's important to note some current limitations:

#### Contextual Awareness

- Each interaction is treated independently. The AI does not retain the context from previous questions. To compensate for this, provide comprehensive information within each query to facilitate a more accurate response.

#### Indexing

- The indexing feature is in the early stages of development. It is anticipated that incorporating metadata extraction, as demonstrated in [LlamaIndex's Metadata Extraction Guide](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/metadata_extraction/MetadataExtraction_LLMSurvey.html), will significantly enhance the AI's ability to retrieve and utilize relevant information from the indexed documentation.

### Limitations and Development Opportunities

As `QuantGPT` evolves, so will its capabilities. Current limitations are opportunities for growth and development:

- **Context Memory:** Future iterations could include context memory for seamless conversations.
- **Metadata Indexing:** Improvements in metadata indexing are expected to refine the AI's understanding and response accuracy.

### Calling All LLM Developers!

If you are an LLM developer or enthusiast, your expertise can help `QuantGPT` reach its full potential. Experimentation, trial, and contributions are highly encouraged. If you have ideas or improvements, please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Your contributions are valuable and always welcome!

## Roadmap

Here's what's on the horizon for `QuantGPT`:

**Near Future:**
- **Context-Aware Conversations:** Implement a full chat mode with memory for richer context.
- **Decoupled Architecture:** Move indexing/querying out of `quantgpt.py` to enable flexible experimentation via a Python notebook.
- **Metadata Enhancements:** Introduce metadata extractions for better search precision.

**Looking Ahead:**
- **Direct Link Indexing:** Add chat capabilities to parse and index content from links in real-time.
- **File Parsing:** Expand the indexing to include file parsing for diverse data formats.

**Long-Term Vision:**
